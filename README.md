# A Blog centred on minimalistic design
===========================================

I should probably mention here that the "Processing" part of this project is just to test and see if it actually works. It should not be taken serously as it might not even be in the final version. 

Also, the image file bg13.jpg takes up a huge portion of the total download size (20MB). So if you have a bad internet, you can skip that file. Thanks for understanding!

## External components used:

1. [Parallax.js](http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/) - Used for backgrounds with parallax scrolling
2. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used by parallax.js
3. [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) - A JS plugin that enables code written in native Processing code (.pde) to be viewed in the browser by converting it into JS
4. A few programs taken from the processing examples!

## Instructions:

1. Webpages can normally be opened directly using browsers. But in this case, due to extra files being needed for the Processing sketches, we need to set up an HTTP server first.
2. Running **START_SERVER.sh** **_should_** do that. And also open up the index page in your browser.
3. After that, its pretty much a website.
4. If that does not work, just open up **index.html** normally. You should be able to see everything except the Processing apps normally.
